         A <span className='font-weight-bold'> neural network</span> is a collection of computer programmed “neurons” that work together to produce a result. Neural networks represent a new programming paradigm, coined Software 2.0 by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy.

        <br/>
        Traditional programming “Software 1.0” involves a programmer writing a program to try to reach a result. Meanwhile, “Software 2.0” involes a programmer letting the program design itself to reach a result.

          <div>
          ... TO DO
          </div>

         Software 1.0 programs consist of explicit instructions written in computer code by a programmer that do not react to their accuracy of producing a desirable result. Meanwhile Software 2.0 programs consist of neural networks that are programmed to constantly change their programming to increase their accuracy of producing a desirable result.
