### Modifying Code
Simplest method is Codepen.
- Pros: Ease of use. Autocompile SASS and React code into processed files. Built-in debugging. Live-preview and autoreload of web page. 
- Cons: Free version of Codepen projects has a maximum file limit of 10 files and a single project. 
1. If you don't have an account on Codepen.io, create one.
2. Go to https://codepen.io/jbunie/project/editor/XgbjqJ
3. Fork the project. 
4. Add files, edit lines, view changes. 
5. When done, export the codepen project into a zip. 
6. Extract files from zip into local git directory, pull from git repo, merge, fix merge changes, and push. 

Another method is Cloud9.
- Pros: Completely free linux workspace on the cloud. No maximum file count. 
- Cons: Compiler, debugger, and livereload must be manually set up. No gulp file created yet. 

Last method is own PC. For linux and Mac users.
